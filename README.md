# Offramp API (FastAPI Wrapper)

A fully-featured **FastAPI backend** that wraps [Bread Africa’s Universal Offramp API](https://bread.africa). This project provides clean HTTP endpoints for quoting, transferring, and tracking crypto-to-fiat offramps using Bread's infrastructure.

> ⚠️ This project is independently built and **not affiliated with Bread Africa**.

---

## 🧩 Features

* ✅ Generate real-time crypto-to-cash quotes
* 💸 Create off-ramp transfers directly to fiat bank accounts
* 🔎 Track transfer status via unique reference
* 🧾 View historical transfer data by wallet address
* 🏦 Lookup bank accounts and fetch supported institutions
* 🌐 List supported tokens, currencies, and blockchains
* 📑 Swagger UI ready out-of-the-box

## 🧪 Available Endpoints

All routes are prefixed with `/offramp`.

| Method | Endpoint                     | Description                             |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/quote`                     | Get a crypto-to-fiat quote              |
| `POST` | `/transfer`                  | Create a transfer from crypto to fiat   |
| `POST` | `/lookup-account`            | Lookup bank account details             |
| `GET`  | `/status/{reference}`        | Fetch the status of a transfer          |
| `GET`  | `/get-transfers`             | Fetch all past transfers for an address |
| `GET`  | `/tokens?blockchain=...`     | Get tokens supported by a blockchain    |
| `GET`  | `/currencies`                | List supported fiat currencies          |
| `GET`  | `/blockchains`               | List supported blockchains              |
| `GET`  | `/institutions?currency=NGN` | Get banks supported for a currency      |

All endpoints return a consistent `ApiResponse`.

## 🧱 Models (Defined in `models.py`)

* `QuoteRequestPayload`
* `TransferRequestPayload`
* `LookupPayload`
* `ApiResponse`

---

## 🧼 Notes

* `offramp_client` is a singleton stored in `app.state` during app lifespan.
* Timeout is 30s for read, 60s for connect — adjust via `offramp_client.py`.
* Handles both `httpx.RequestError` and `httpx.HTTPStatusError` gracefully with logs.
